Once you configure this tool to have a service, CAS is no longer considered open and thus any application that wishes to use CAS must be registered in this tool.  That includes <strong>THIS TOOL</strong>. If you are going to use this tool, the FIRST SERVICE TO ADD IS THIS SERVICE ITSELF.  The default Service Management Tool URL is <strong>"{0}"</strong>.
